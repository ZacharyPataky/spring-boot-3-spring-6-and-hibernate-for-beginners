# spring-boot-3-spring-6-and-hibernate-for-beginners
This repository contains the code written during my time studying Chad Darby's [Spring Boot 3, Spring 6, and Hibernate for Beginners] course on Udemy.

This course is the most comprehensive and best-selling Spring Boot and Hibernate course on Udemy.  It covers the following hot topics intimately:

* Spring Boot 3
* Spring Framework 6
* Spring Boot Core
* Spring Boot Annotations
* Spring Boot Java COnfiguration (all Java, no XML)
* Spring Boot and Spring MVC
* Spring Boot Hibernate / JPA CRUD
* Spring Boot Security
* Spring Boot REST API
* Maven

It then strengthens our understanding of these topics by providing the following real-time projects:

* Spring Boot REST API (with full database CRUD real-time project)
* Spring Boot REST API Security (with password encryption in the database)
* Spring Boot with JPA and Spring Data JPA (with full database CRUD real-time project)
* Spring Boot with Spring Dat aREST (wit hfull database CRUD real-time project)
* Spring Boot with Spring MVC, Thymeleaf (With full database CRUD real-time project)

Feel free to look around if you need a quick refresher on any topic.  I feel like I may periodically snoop back here myself.
